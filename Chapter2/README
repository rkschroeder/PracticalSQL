# Chapter 2: Introduction to Databases

This chapter focuses on basic database operations, including:

- Creating a database.
- Creating tables within the database.
- Inserting data into the tables.

The instructions from the book were followed, and the sample data provided was used to practice these concepts.

## Additional Features

To enhance the learning experience, the following functionalities were added:

### 1. Adding More Data
- Custom functions were created to allow for the insertion of additional data into the database beyond the book's examples.

### 2. Input Validation
- Implemented validation to ensure all inputs are in the correct format before being added to the database.

### 3. Duplicate Entry Prevention
- Added functionality to check whether the data already exists in the database. This ensures no duplicate records are added.

## Learning Goals

By implementing these features, the following concepts were practiced:

- Writing and running SQL commands.
- Validating user inputs programmatically.
- Enhancing database workflows with additional Python logic.
